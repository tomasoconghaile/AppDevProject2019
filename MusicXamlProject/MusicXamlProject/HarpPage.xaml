            <Label TextColor="LimeGreen" FontSize="Medium" Text="Harp is a string instrument. Each string is tight, so it makes the right sound or note for that string. The strings are tied to the frame.  The frame is usually a wood triangle. It must be strong, so that the many tight strings do not break it.  The side of the triangle that leans on the player's body, is the sound-box. Empty boxes can make sounds louder."/>
            <Label TextColor="LimeGreen" FontSize="Medium" Text="Harp players pluck the strings with their fingers. This makes the strings move so that the strings make sounds. Each string sound is a different musical note. Harp players play songs by plucking the strings in the right order and at the right time. More than one string can be plucked at the same time."/>
