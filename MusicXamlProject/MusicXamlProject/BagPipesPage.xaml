            <Label TextColor="LimeGreen" FontSize="Medium" Text="The bagpipes are a musical instrument. They are sometimes just called pipes. They have a bag that holds air. The player keeps the bag full of air by blowing into it with a tube or pumping it with a bellows. To make music, the bag is pressed and the air comes out through a kind of flute or chanter."/>

            <Label TextColor="LimeGreen" FontSize="Medium" Text="There are usually one or more other tubes coming from the bag that make sounds whenever the bag is squeezed, called drones. Each drone normally plays a different note, and stays on the same note the whole time it is playing, to play a harmony with the chanter. The sounds are made by a single or, more commonly, double reed which vibrates when air is blown over it."/>

            <Label TextColor="LimeGreen" FontSize="Medium" Text="Scotland is traditionally linked to the bagpipes, and many pipe tunes come from there. Many, many other places, however, also have different types of bagpipes: over all of Europe, some of North Africa, and into the Middle East."/>
